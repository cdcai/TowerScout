# TowerScout

A tool for identifying cooling towers from satellite and aerial imagery.  Cooling towers are potential sources of _Legionella_ bacteria, which causes Legionnaire's disease.  TowerScout has been utilized in over 12 investigations of outbreaks of Legionnaire's disease across 8 states since 2021.  It can be used after outbreaks to identify potential sources of _Legionella_, and it can be used before outbreaks to build and update a registry of cooling towers to aid future investigations.

## About TowerScout 

The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://cdc.gov) have [procedures](https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/health-depts/environmental-inv-resources/id-cooling-towers.html) for identifying cooling towers during investigation of an outbreak of Legionnaire's disease, which can be significantly sped up by using TowerScout.  TowerScout has been utilized in over 12 investigations of outbreaks of Legionnaire's disease across 8 states since 2021.  In 2021, TowerScout was the [Hal Varian Award Winner](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mids/capstone/varianaward) for the [Master of Information and Data Science Program (MIDS)](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mids) in the [School of Information](https://ischool.berkeley.edu) at [UC Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu).  

TowerScout has been utilized by local health departments:
- The the Utah Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) utilized TowerScout for [detecting cooling towers](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2023-07-04-cooling-tower-update/) in aerial imagery.
- The Los Angeles County Enterprise GIS (eGIS) team and Department of Public Health utilized TowerScout to build an initial dataset of likely cooling tower locations across the County.  The work was the [2023 NACo Achievement Award Winner, Information Technology (Best in Category)](https://www.naco.org/resources/award-programs/towerscout-adaptation-%E2%80%93-automated-image-analysis-identify-cooling-towers).
